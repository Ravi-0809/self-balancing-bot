The bot was stabilized using PID control algorithm. After many trial and error attempts the PID values for which the bot achieved desirable stability are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item P =
  \item I =
  \item D =\\
\end{itemize}

Another important observation from building the bot was that the bot stabilizes faster and in a more desirable manner when the battery is placed not at the bottom but closer to the top of the chassis.
