After being stabilised by electronics means, self-balancing bots can be loaded with platforms or manipulators, working in human controlled or even completely autonomous operation, and might be used in industrial autonomous transportations systems or warehouses in the future. Models have already been made for employing sleek robots with a low footprint as assistants in hospitals or waiters in restaurants.\\

The use of one variable as the sole manipulator for motion on one axis creates a huge window for simple control by varying the desired setpoint. Better motors (high resolution stepper motors with decent torque) can be implemented to make a smoother and more stable balance system.\\

Different control strategies like State Control or LQR can be experimented with as well as many assumptions can be theorised for better control and stability.
