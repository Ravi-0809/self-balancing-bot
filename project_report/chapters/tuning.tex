Although the use of the PID algorithm for control does not guarantee optimal control of the system or system stability, it sure is easy to tune.\newline
Steps used in tuning are :
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set the values of I, D to 0.
  \item Stabilize system as much as possible using only the proportional gain, P.
  \item Set I to remove the steady state error from the system.
  \item Finally, damp the oscillations of the system caused by P by setting D. This helps the bot achieve steady state faster and hence improves response.
\end{enumerate}
