For nearly two decades research and development of self-balancing vehicles is taking place. With the upcoming availability of low-cost, high performance MEMS sensor technology, the use of inertial sensors can be used in self-balancing concepts in robotics.
A two-wheeled self-balancing system is unstable inherently.\\

After being stabilised by electronics means, they can be loaded with platforms or manipulators, working in human controlled or even completely autonomous operation, might be used in industrial autonomous transportations systems or warehouses in the future.
A two-wheeled self-balancing robot is representing a mobile inverted pendulum, which is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory.\\

Taking inspiration from present day research and utilities of a self balancing bot, the topic was chosen as a course project for the course of 'Modern Control Systems', to showcase a simple feedback controlled bot. The basic aim of the project is to build a two wheeled self-balancing bot on top of which is a mounted self-balancing platform.\\

The project showcases the use of a standard PID controller to stabilize the oscillations of the bot and hence balance it about its mean position. The same is applied to balance the self-balancing table such that it never tilts.\\
