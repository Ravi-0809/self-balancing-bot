This report is compiled on the basis of a hardware implemented self-balancing robot. Firstly, the report talks about the basic PID control algorithm which is used to stabilize the bot and the platform individually about thier mean positions. Further, the dynamics of a self-balancing bot are talked about in breif. Later, the mechanical construction of the bot built for this project. Further, the tuning and operation of the bot is presented at different operating conditions. Finally, the future prospects are discussed following which the report is concluded with the relevant observations and results.
